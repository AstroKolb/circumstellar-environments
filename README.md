# circumstellar-environments


to do list

1.  verify working code
2.  run with compiler flags
3.  test mass conservation for steady flow, isothermal+adiabatic
4.  edit grid (zoom, overlap)
5.  add primary gravity, test mass conservation for parker wind
6.  add wind profile, test mass conservation (do this in 1D too...)
7.  add pseudoforces, test mass conservation
8.  test min radius
9.  add accretion, test..
10. add cooling, test..


# 2. Run with compiler flags

Many issues found, should be working now
still need to run with -Wall at some point


# 1. Verifying working code 
(downloaded from DrB email, some reorganization)

Code is working, appears to generate a SSDW
